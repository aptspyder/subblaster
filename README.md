# SubBlaster

**The Anti-Ban DNS Brute Forcer.**

SubBlaster is a high-performance subdomain enumeration tool designed for active reconnaissance. Unlike passive tools that rely on outdated logs, SubBlaster performs high-speed DNS brute forcing to find live, hidden subdomains that other hunters miss.

It features a custom **Anti-Ban Engine (Jitter)** that randomizes request timing, allowing you to scan sensitive targets without triggering WAFs or Rate Limits.

##  Key Features

- **Pure Brute Force:** No API keys, no logs. Direct DNS querying for fresh results.
- **WAF Evasion:** Built-in "Jitter" mode adds randomized delays to mimic human traffic.
- **Wildcard Filtering:** Auto-detects and filters wildcard DNS records.
- **High Concurrency:** Multi-threaded Go architecture capable of high-speed scanning.
